* TicTacToe Workthrough
___

## Presentation "Exploratory Data Analysis" by Andrew"

____

* Why?
Initial investigations on your data are KEY in order to understand them - which again is 
necessary for further data analyses and future predictions

* Understanding the concept
* Knowledge about the steps within an EDA 

	1. Understand your data         --> Browse the data, columns and data types...
	2. Build hypotheses             --> What are your assumptions: Ask yourself questions...
	3. Explore your data            --> Hav a look at distribution of your data...
	4. Clean your data              --> Deal with missing values, why are they missing...
	5. Deep Dive: Missing values    --> Standard missing values, Non-standard missing values...
	5. Deep Dive: Outliers          --> Result of mistake during data collection (bad data)...
	5. Check for relationships      --> Check for correlation between values...
	6. Back to your hypothesis      --> Confirm or reject each of your hypothesis...
	7. Fine tuning                  --> Make yourself ready for presenting your insights...
	8. Explain your reasoning       --> Add explanations and overviews

--> EDA is a big field of many processes and information so please follow the external links for more information

Attributes/Methods | Description
--------|----------
head([n]) |  Return the first n rows.
iloc  | Purely integer-location based indexing for selection by position.
index| The index (row labels) of the DataFrame.
loc| Access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array.
bool() | Return the bool of a single element.
count([axis, level, numeric_only]) |Count non-NA cells for each column or row.
shape | Return a tuple representing the dimensionality of the DataFrame.
info([verbose, buf, max_cols, memory_usage, …]) | Print a concise summary of a DataFrame.
